                            <h2>Skill Challenge Rules</h2>
                            <p class="wrap-p">"Before participating     matches.       
                            (Insert website name) deducts 12.5% of any prize money in head-to-head tournaments, while any service fee stands to be cancelled if the match does not take place. 
                            Match results are liable to verification or disputes after 1 hour of a playing member filing the outcome. Results will be automatically verified if there is no dispute raised during this time period.  Unless a match is not reported after two hours, the results shall be considered invalid and subsequently, will not be added to a player’s profile and the players shall receive a refund. Any match that is cancelled cannot be revoked and will be wiped from our system. 
                            In order to establish any custom rules and game play settings, you must add/document them in the Pre-game comments section of any tournament. Any rule that is not present in this section cannot be implemented in the tournament and those that are, will be considered binding for the duration of that tournament. Both parties shall agree to the stated rules in the pre-game section, unless they speak out before commencement. Any other regulation that does not pertain to game play cannot be implemented, whilst any occurring glitch shall be counted as part of the rules, whether it is agreed beforehand or not. 
                            Team and player customizations are not allowed unless stated beforehand and use of such features without prior knowledge shall result in immediate forfeit for the applicable party. Furthermore, consistent rule violations of this nature shall result in account closure. 
                            Without informing opponents beforehand, it is understood that all challenges are to be played on a 1v1 basis with no 3rd party players allowed. 
                            For games that are played with excessive lagging, unless they are exited immediately and we see no disadvantage for both sides, the match will have to be played out as we cannot deprive anyone of a legitimate score. However, any lagging caused intentionally will be penalized with an automatic loss.
                            To validate any point spread, both parties must acknowledge this before taking part in a challenge. Point spreads will be added as per the usual rules to the final score unless there is prior intimation. In a case where a rule is broken and the game is exited, the points will be added from that time period.</p>
                            <h2>Dispute</h2>
                            <p class="wrap-p">Disputes can be raised while posting match results and can be done through the matches tab on your (insert website name) page. However, to process such requests we require evidence backing that claim without which the application shall be considered invalid. 
                            Any claim based on pre-game settings including amount of time period, skill level, rosters, injured players, disallowed teams, who is supposed to be home team, jersey color, weather and game title can be waived away depending on the amount of time played. If you think your opponent has an unfair advantage, please exit the game and launch a claim, as any game played more than 25% shall be invalidated. Furthermore, if you play a game and wait for an opponent to use an unfair advantage, then your claim shall NOT be considered. 
                            We do not offer any forfeit wins in 1v1, thus claiming a win when the opponent has forfeited prior to starting a match shall result in a dispute your profile and fine up to the full match amount. 
                            Intentionally exiting a losing game or a tie without any supporting evidence shall result in time concession. Moreover, even if you are winning, exiting without due cause will result in conceding time. 
                            Without providing evidence, any claim for a win in a game already lost, shall lead to automatic forfeit. 
                            Any early claims when the game is not fully decided will lead to an unfavorable decision. If the proceedings are determined to be completely one-sided at one point, the score at that particular time will be used. However, if your opponent claims a win during a game and you receive supporting evidence but continue to play past that point, any resultant claims shall be invalid. 
                            Provision of inaccurate, incomplete and fault information/evidence to manipulate (Insert website name) during a dispute/claim process, can result in a forfeit and hefty fine up to the total match amount as well as possible suspension. 
                            Any attempts are misleading or gaining unfair advantages over an opponent shall result in a forfeit. 
                            We aim to resolve all raised disputes within 24 hours and all such decisions taken by our staff shall be final. However, if you still wish to stake a claim and order an additional review, you must provide supporting evidence for such a decision. </p>
                            <h2>No Cheating allowed</h2>
                            <p>Whilst winning, drawing or losing the match, if a player proves that their opponent has broken a rule it shall result in an immediate mach exit, with the culprit conceding the remaining time and losing the overall match.
                            In a case where a rule was broken during a game, but not reported as such, the match will be declared as a draw with all the money minus the (Insert website name) fee. However, if such an infringement of the rules has had a direct effect on the final score, then a claim is warranted. 
                            Violation of any decreed rules and regulations shall result in an immediate dispute on the offender’s profile and liable to punishment as per our judgment. </p>
                            <h2>Suggested 1v1 rule sets</h2>
                            <p>(Insert website name) rules are regularly applied by players for 1v1 games. However, these are suggested rule sets only and are not applicable on 1v1 FIFA matches, therefore must be announced prior in the pre-game comments section. If you wish to see a detailed rule set, please check our dedicated tab button here (insert rule tab link).</p>
                            <h2>Disconnections</h2>
                            <p>Members undertake all responsibility to fully comprehend and understand all rules and regulations prior to taking part in any tournament – this rule applies to all matches. 
                            In a case where a game is disconnected, all efforts are made to ensure accurate recreation to the point of disconnection, so that play is resumed with the correct score and remaining time.
                            It is expected that all users/players will exit a game once the time limit has been played out. However, if no such exit takes place, any more time played will be considered valid and added to the final score. Point spreads shall be added to the total score as per our rules, unless the players have agreed to other verifiable conditions prior to the game. Any game not fully played shall be subjected to review.  
                            Any description of how a game should be played/completed needs to be dealt with before starting the actual match. If a new game is initiated based on the intention to play out the remaining time and issues are raised with teams, the ball, the spot of the ball, player injuries etc, then you should immediately exit and present supporting evidence. However, if the game goes on, then your claim shall not be validated. Actions intimated to go against our disconnection policy during a game which you are losing shall result in an automatic forfeit.
                            Following our disconnection policy is integral. And refusal to comply with these rules whilst you are losing or tied, will lead to automatic forfeit from a game. Even in cases where you are winning and do not respond to our disconnection policy, you shall be liable for an unfavorable decision. We do not force re-matches or re-schedules; therefore if you are unable to comply within reasonable time lines (5-10 minutes), then it shall result in a forfeit. 
                            We reserve the right to forfeit a game in a disconnection scenario, where the circumstances do not cater to the remaining time and the afore-played situation cannot be wholly recreated. 
                            In some situations, a player can be kicked out for “excessive grieving”, which should be treated as disconnection unless supporting evidence against it can be provided. Getting kicked out for excessive grieving whilst losing a match results in forfeiting the time, while if you do the same when winning, it leads to an unfavorable decision. </p>
